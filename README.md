# Customer Churn Prediction
Problem: A subscription-based service is experiencing high customer churn. Retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. We can build a predictive model that identifies customers at high risk of churn, so the company can intervene (discounts, support outreach). Dataset: Telco Customer Churn Dataset (contains labels churn/no churn).  We will use structured data to build a baseline predictive model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost). A couple of options to use LLM 1)  to infer high-level behavioral signals—such as churn risk or customer persona—which will be encoded as additional features for the model. For example, Churn Risk Level: High / Medium / Low or Customer Persona: Deal-Seeker / Passive User / Loyalist. and 2) generate a summary why the customer may churn, prompt may look like this: "Explain why this customer is likely to churn based on their activity and sentiment."
# Customer Churn Prediction Project

This is our group project for predicting customer churn using machine learning models. The goal is to identify which customers are likely to leave a telecom service, so the company can take action ahead of time.

## Dataset
We're using the [Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) from Kaggle. This dataset includes information on 7,043 customers from a telecom company, including customer demographics, account information, services subscribed to, and whether or not the customer churned. The dataset has 21 columns and is suitable for binary classification tasks.

## Team Tasks (In Progress)
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Exploratory analysis and visualizations
- Model building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Final report and deployment planning

More updates coming soon.
