# Customer Churn Prediction
Problem: A subscription-based service is experiencing high customer churn. Retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. We can build a predictive model that identifies customers at high risk of churn, so the company can intervene (discounts, support outreach). Dataset: Telco Customer Churn Dataset (contains labels churn/no churn).  We will use structured data to build a baseline predictive model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost). A couple of options to use LLM 1)  to infer high-level behavioral signals—such as churn risk or customer persona—which will be encoded as additional features for the model. For example, Churn Risk Level: High / Medium / Low or Customer Persona: Deal-Seeker / Passive User / Loyalist. and 2) generate a summary why the customer may churn, prompt may look like this: "Explain why this customer is likely to churn based on their activity and sentiment."
